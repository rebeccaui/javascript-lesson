## Intro to JavaScript (60 minutes)
#### By: Rebecca Wieberdink Copyright 2019

Prior Knowledge: HTML and CSS, basics of Git and Github

Main Concepts: JavaScript objects,

Vocabulary: variable, object, array, function, conditionals, if/else, console.log, alert, prompt, confirm

### Student Goals: 
    Students understand that JavaScript adds functionality and interactivity to a webpage.

    Students can use JS functions to send and display information to the console.

    Students can use basic JS functions, such as alert() and prompt(), to interact with the user.

### Opening Demo (5 minutes) 
Show students two websites: one with no functionality and one with JS functionality. 

Explain the JavaScript can make dynamic changes to the webpage, provide animation, understand/utilize user input, etc.
Point out HTML and CSS parts of each site, then try to isolate JavaScript functionalities. 

### Introduction PowerPoint (10 minutes)
Go through the PowerPoint to describe JS in terms of studentsâ€™ current understanding of coding languages. 
Concepts: 

- Writing JS and programming are skills, like math. They require understanding small parts, understanding how they interact, and ways to combine them or use them strategically to solve a problem (like a word problem in math). 
- JS requires practice!
- File pathing and organization
- How JS script looks in an HTML document and how it looks as an external file
    - JS code can be placed in the head or the body or both within an HTML document.
- JS provides opportunities for customer interactions 
- Variable types: strings, numbers, booleans
- JS is a dynamically typed language, so we don't need to define types
    - variable values can change their types during runtime

### Activity 1: Various Types of Variables (Students Do: 10 minutes)

Tell students that they will now be:
1.	Declaring variables
2.	Making predictions about what will display on the screen 
3.	Opening the page in a browser to check the results
Give students ten minutes to share screen and complete assignment.

Students will download this file in the class activities Slack channel. Encourage them to use the cloud-shaped download button. 

### Activity 1.5: Various Types of Variables Review (Instructors Do: 3 minutes)

Use this time to engage students and have them call out answers they used and explain them further. Explain further about how to combine variables and strings inside alerts.

//==============================================================

### Introduction PowerPoint Cont. (Instructors Do: 5 minutes)

Discuss the three different functions, `confirm`, `alert`, and `prompt`. 
Explain how this allows for user interaction. 
    The alert tells the user something, but the other two functions gather user input.
Explain what data returns from each function. 

### Activity 2: Talk to Me (Students Do: 10 minutes)

Students will download this file in the class activities Slack channel. 
It involves creating functions for different ways one can interact with the user. 

//==============================================================

### Introduction PowerPoint Cont. (Instructors Do: 5 minutes)

Discuss arrays as being collections or lists of variables. 
Explain how the syntax works.
Explain how the index system works, begins at 0 and ends at a number one lower than the length of the array. 
Explain what console.log means and how it is used and accessed.

### Activity 3: Hooray for Arrays! (Students Do: 5 minutes)

Tell students that they will now be:
1.	Using arrays to print words to the console
2.	Explaining and writing their own console.log function 
3.	Opening the page in a browser to check the results
Give students ten minutes to share screen and complete assignment.

Students will download this file in the class activities Slack channel. 

### Activity 3: Hooray for Arrays Review (Instructors Do: 5 minutes)

Use this time to engage students and have them call out answers and ask leading questions so that they use reasoning. "How do you know...?"
